# 3D Food bar: Cook

## Description

## Requirements(with versions we tested on)
- **nodejs** 20.11.0
- **npm** 10.2.4
- **vite** 5.1.4
- **postcss** 8.4.35
- **nanoid** 3.3.7

## Install

### Two ways for installing
#### From three.js document
1. Install [Node.js](https://https://nodejs.org/en). We'll need it to load manage dependencies and to run our build tool.
2. Install three.js and a build tool, [vite](https://https://vitejs.dev/) using a [terminal](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/) in your project folder. Vite will be used during development, but it isn't part of the final webpage. If you prefer to use another build tool, that's fine â€” we support modern build tools that can import [ES Modules](https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/10_modules.html#h_zWTXAU93DC).
 
   ```
    # three.js
    npm install --save 

    # vite
    npm install --save-dev vite
3. Run vite
   ``` 
   npx vite
4. If everything went well, you'll see a URL like http://localhost:5173 appear in your terminal, and can open that URL to see your web application.
#### By my package-lock.json
1. Install [Node.js](https://https://nodejs.org/en). We'll need it to load manage dependencies and to run our build tool.
2. From your terminal run:       
   ```
   npm install package-lock.json
   npm fund // to check your dependencies of your project
3. Run vite
   ``` 
   npx vite
4. If everything went well, you'll see a URL like http://localhost:5173 appear in your terminal, and can open that URL to see your web application.
